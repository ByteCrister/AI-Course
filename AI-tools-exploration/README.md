# AI Tools Exploration - README

This folder contains two AI-generated resources for the **AI Tools Exploration** project:

1. ðŸ“¹ **Video** - A 1-minute video summarizing the AI course, combining theoretical concepts and lab tasks (Algorithms & Games).
2. ðŸ“Š **Presentation Slide** - A 10â€“12-slide deck created with the help of AI, showcasing topics covered in the AI course and lab applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Steps Taken

### ðŸŽ¥ Video Creation Process (Using **Pictory**):

1. **Topic Gathering**: I listed all major theory topics and lab tasks (Algorithms and Games) covered during the AI course.
2. **Script Generation**: I used **ChatGPT** to generate a video script summarizing these topics in a concise and engaging way.
3. **Script Enhancement**: I refined the script manually and enhanced it again using ChatGPT for clarity and engagement.
4. **AI Video Creation**: I pasted the final script into **Pictory**, selected a suitable template, and let the AI generate visuals and voice-over.
5. **Final Touches**: Made minor edits using Pictoryâ€™s built-in AI suggestions for better visual flow and timing.

### ðŸ“Š Presentation Slide Creation (Using **Gamma**):

1. **Prompt Crafting**: I wrote a strong, detailed prompt for the slides with the help of **ChatGPT**, describing what the slides should include.
2. **AI Slide Generation**: I used this prompt in **Gamma**, which generated an initial version of the presentation.
3. **Slide Refinement**: Enhanced the visuals and added AI-recommended structure/layout improvements using Gammaâ€™s smart editor.
4. **Final Review**: Proofread content, checked for consistency, and ensured slide count met the requirement (10â€“12 slides).

## âœ… Outcome

By using AI tools throughout the creation process, I was able to:

- Automate content generation (script + slides)
- Improve the professional quality of both video and slides
- Learn how AI can assist in real-world media production workflows

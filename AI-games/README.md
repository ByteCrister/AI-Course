## 🧠 Games Implemented with AI

This folder contains individual projects demonstrating AI strategies in the following games:

- **Tic-Tac-Toe** – Implemented with Minimax algorithm and optimal strategy logic.
- **Chess** – Simplified AI opponent using rule-based evaluation or search pruning techniques.
- **Reversi (Othello)** – Includes logic for board evaluation and strategic move selection.

Each game demonstrates fundamental concepts of:
- Search algorithms (e.g., Minimax, DFS, BFS)
- Game trees and evaluation heuristics
- Decision-making under constraints
